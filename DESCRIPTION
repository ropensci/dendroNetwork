Description: Creating dendrochronological networks based on the similarity between tree-ring series or chronologies. The package includes various functions to compare tree-ring curves building upon the 'dplR' package. The networks can be used to visualise and understand the relations between tree-ring curves. These networks are also very useful to estimate the provenance of wood as described in Visser (2021) <DOI:10.5334/jcaa.79> or wood-use within a structure/context/site as described in Visser and Vorst (2022) <DOI:10.1163/27723194-bja10014>.
