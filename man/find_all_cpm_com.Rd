\title{Finding all CPM communities in a network/graph
Function to determine all CPM-communities in a network (or graph) using the clique percolation method (Palla et al 2005).}
\usage{
find_all_cpm_com(graph_input, n_core = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph_input}{the graph for find all CPM communities in}

\item{n_core}{this defaults to 0, if a number larger than 1 is given the community detection is performed using parallel computing}
}
\value{
data frame with at least two columns. The first column are the node names and the further columns represent the CPM-communities, with 1 denoting the membership in a community.
}
\description{
The CPM makes use of complete graphs or cliques in the network. A clique is a group of nodes were all of them are connected. A clique of 3 nodes has 3 edges, while a clique of 4 nodes has already 6 edges. Communities in CPM consist of a large group of connected cliques.

data(hol_rom)
sim_table_hol <- sim_table(hol_rom)
g_hol <- dendro_network(sim_table_hol)
hol_com_cpm_all <- find_all_cpm_com(g_hol)
