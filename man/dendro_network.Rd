\title{Create dendrochronologial networks}
\usage{
dendro_network(
  sim_table,
  r_threshold = 0.5,
  sgc_threshold = 0.7,
  p_threshold = 1e-04,
  corr_type = "r_hol"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sim_table}{a table of similarities created by the sim_table() function}

\item{r_threshold}{all correlations equal or above this value are taken into account for the creation of edges. If you want all positive correlations included set this to 0.}

\item{sgc_threshold}{all sgc-values equal or above this value are taken into account for the creation of edges.}

\item{p_threshold}{all probabilities of exceedence equal or below this value are taken into account for the creation of edges.}

\item{corr_type}{choose between the correlation based on wuchswerte (r_hol: Hollstein 1980) or the correlation without extra transformation (r)}
}
\value{
A simplified network of tree-ring material with the edges defined by the similarity.
}
\description{
Function to create dendrochronological networks based on the similarity. The input for this function is a similarity table created with the sim_table() function. The thresholds are set to the defaults (Visser 2021).
}
\examples{
data(hol_rom)
sim_table_hol <- sim_table(hol_rom)
g_hol <- dendro_network(sim_table_hol)
plot(g_hol)
g_hol_r_low <- dendro_network(sim_table_hol, r_threshold = 0.3,
                                sgc_threshold = 0.6, corr_type = "r")
plot(g_hol_r_low)
