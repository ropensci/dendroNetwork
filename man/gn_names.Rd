\title{Community detection using the Girvan-Newman algorithm}
\usage{
gn_names(g)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{input graph or network that is used for community detection}
}
\value{
the names of the nodes in the various communities
}
\description{
Function to determine the communities in a network using the Girvan-Newman algorithm. This function uses the cluster_edge_betweenness() function from the iGraph package, but creates a more user-friendly output that includes the names of the nodes.
}
\details{
The GN-algorithm uses the edge betweenness to determine communities. Edge betweenness is the number of shortest paths between pairs of nodes running over that edge. The higher the edge betweenness, the more communities an edge connects. Therefore these are removed in this algorithm to detect communities.
