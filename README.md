dendroNetwork is a package to create dendrochronological networks for
gaining insight into provenance or other patterns based on the
statistical relations between tree ring curves. The code and the
functions are based on several published papers (Visser 2021b, 2021a;
Visser and Vorst 2022).

The package is written for dendrochronologists and have a general
knowledge on the discipline and used jargon. There is an excellent
website for the introduction of using R in dendrochronology:
<https://opendendro.org/r/>. The basics of dendrochronology can be found
in handbooks (Cook and Kariukstis 1990; Speer 2010) or on
<https://www.dendrohub.com/>.

## Installation

This package depends on
[RCy3](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RCy3.html),
which is part of Bioconductor. Therefore it is recommended to install
RCy3 first using:

``` r
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("RCy3")
```

The functionality of RCy3 depends on the installation of Cytoscape.
Cytoscape is needed for visualising the networks. This open source
software is platform independent and provides easy visual access to
complex networks and the attributes of both nodes and edges in a network
(see the
[Cytoscape-website](https://cytoscape.org/what_is_cytoscape.html) for
more information). It is therefore recommended to install Cytoscape as
well. Please follow the download and installation instructions for your
operating system: <https://cytoscape.org/>.

You can install the development version of dendroNetwork from
[GitHub](https://github.com/ropensci/dendroNetwork) with:

``` r
install.packages("dendroNetwork", repos = "https://ropensci.r-universe.dev")
```

## Usage

The package aims to make the creation of dendrochronological
(provenance) networks as easy as possible. To be able to make use of all
options, it is assumed that Cytoscape (Shannon et al. 2003)is installed
(<https://cytoscape.org/>). Some data is included in this package,
namely the Roman data published by Hollstein (Hollstein 1980).

The first steps are visualized in the flowchart below, including
community detection using either (or both) the Girvan-Newman algorithm
(Girvan and Newman 2002) and Clique Percolation Method (Palla et al.
2005) for all clique sizes. Both methods are explained very well in the
papers, and on wikipedia for both
[CPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_percolation_method) and the
[Girvan-Newman
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girvan%E2%80%93Newman_algorithm).

sim_table_hol <- sim_table(hol_rom) # 2
g_hol <- dendro_network(sim_table_hol) # 3

g_hol_cpm <- clique_community_names(g_hol, k=3) # 4
hol_com_cpm_all <- find_all_cpm_com(g_hol) # 5
plot(g_hol)  # plotting the graph in R
```

     vertex.label.color="darkslategrey", vertex.label.cex=0.8, vertex.label.dist=2) # better readable version

### Visualization in Cytoscape

After creating the network in R, it is possible to visualize the network
using Cytoscape. The main advantage is that visualisation in Cytoscape
is more easy, intuitive and visual. In addition, it is very easy to
automate workflows in Cytoscape with R (using
[RCy3](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RCy3.html)).
For this purpose we need to start Cytoscape firstly. After Cytoscape has
completely loaded, the next steps can be taken.

1.  The network can now be loaded in Cytoscape for further
    visualisation:
    `cyto_create_graph(g_hol, CPM_table = hol_com_cpm_all, GN_table = g_hol_gn)`
2.  Styles for visualisation can now be generated. However, Cytoscape
    comes with a lot of default styles that can be confusing. Therefore
    it is recommended to use: `cyto_clean_styles()` once in a session.
3.  To visualize the styles for CPM with only k=3:
    `cyto_create_cpm_style(g_hol, k=3, com_k = g_hol_cpm)`
    - This can be repeated for all possible clique sizes. To find the
      maximum clique size in a network, please use:
      `igraph::clique_num(g_hol)`.
    - To automate this:
      `for (i in 3:igraph::clique_num(g_hol)) { cyto_create_cpm_style(g_hol, k=i, com_k = g_hol_cpm)}`.
4.  To visualize the styles using the Girvan-Newman algorithm (GN):
    `cyto_create_gn_style(g_hol)` This would look something like this in
    Cytoscape:

alt="The network of Roman sitechronologies with the Girvan-Newman communities visualized." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The network of Roman sitechronologies
with the Girvan-Newman communities visualized.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Usage for large datasets

When using larger datasets of tree-ring series, calculating the table
with similarities can take a lot of time, but finding communities even
more. It is therefore recommended to use of parallel computing for
Clique Percolation:
`clique_community_names_par(network, k=3, n_core = 4)`. This reduces the
amount of time significantly. For most datasets
`clique_community_names()` is sufficiently fast and for smaller datasets
`clique_community_names_par()` can even be slower due to the
parallelisation. Therefore, the function `clique_community_names()`
should be used initially and if this is very slow, start using
`clique_community_names_par()`. See the separate
[vignette](docs.ropensci.org/dendroNetwork/articles/large_datasets_communities.html)
for that.
